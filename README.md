# Project3_Cloud_Data_Pipeline
Cloud Data Pipeline: Supermarket Sales Analysis

In this project, I built a cloud-based data pipeline to analyze supermarket sales data. The pipeline integrates AWS S3, Snowflake, and Tableau Public to demonstrate real-world data engineering and analytics skills.

📂 Project Workflow

Data Storage (AWS S3)

Uploaded the raw supermarket sales CSV file into an S3 bucket.

Data Warehouse (Snowflake)

Created a database and table in Snowflake.

Loaded the dataset from AWS S3 into Snowflake.

Cleaned column names and transformed data for analysis.

Data Visualization (Tableau Public)

Connected Tableau Public to Snowflake.

Built an interactive dashboard to visualize key business insights.
